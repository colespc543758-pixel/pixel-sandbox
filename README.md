Here is a professional, high-energy README.md template designed to make your GitHub repository stand out.

To use this, create a new file named README.md in your project folder and paste the following:

Pixel Sandbox: Architect Edition (v3.0)
Pixel Sandbox is a high-octane, browser-based physics playground built for total creative chaos. Unlike traditional engines that freeze objects to save CPU, our Infinite Motion Engine keeps every single atom awake and interacting 100% of the time.

PLAY THE LIVE DEMO NOW!!!

Features That Hit Different
Zero Physics Sleep: Hard-coded to prevent the engine from pausing inactive bodies. If it exists, it moves.

LA-95 Obliterator: A precision kinetic tool that vaporizes targets and flings nearby entities with a realistic inverse-square force blast.

Avatar Customizer: Procedural attachment system. Toggle your Top Hat and customize your suit/tool colors directly from the mainframe.

4 Deployment Zones: From the flat "Construct" plains to the vertical "High-Rise" towers.

State Persistence: Save your complex builds to local storage and reload them instantly with K and O.
